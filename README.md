# macOS Installer Builder
Generate macOS installers for your applications and products from one command.

For more detailed process please refer medium blog about the macOS installer builder: https://medium.com/swlh/the-easiest-way-to-build-macos-installer-for-your-application-34a11dd08744

# Usage: (my fork)
In `installroot` directory, place the files to be installed in a directory structure as they would be installed on the target system, starting from root.
For example, `installroot/Application/A.app` would install `A.app` into the `/Application` directory of the target system.

`darwin/scripts/postinstall` contains the script to be executed post install.

`darwin/Resources` contains the resources (text, images, etc) used by the installer.

`target` directory is generated by the script; do not make modifications to it. The final installer package (the output of `productbuild`) is placed in `target/pkg`. The individual packages (built by `pkgbuild`) are placed in `target/package`.

To create the installer, execute `build-macos-x64.sh APPNAME VERSION`.
